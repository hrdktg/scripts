Either find a way or make one.
Doesnt Matter how slowly you go as long as you dont stop.
Try..One More Time.
learn the rules...play better than anyone else.
Even if you fall in your face you are still moving forward.

Dont Wait time will never be just right start where you stand whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.

There are no accidents.

Either you run the day or the day runs you.

Do work with your whole heart and you will succeed there is so little competition.

Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.

Dream is not what you see in sleep...Its something that doesnt let you sleep.

The goal is not to live forever...its to make something that does.
